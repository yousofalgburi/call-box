Created a header component that will hold the nav inside. The header centers the nav and the nav centers the elements inside of it using flex box.
The dropdown menu was achived by creating a dropdown content div that contains the content to be displayed when the dropdown button is clicked.
JavaScript conditionally displays the content when a user clicks the dropdown button and hides it when they click anywhere else on the site. 
The navbar has an active feature where JavaScript assigns an active class to currently active tab. Improvements can be made by displaying a burger
icon on smaller devices but the navbar fully renders and functions correctly with a device of any size.
