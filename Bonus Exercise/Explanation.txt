The first solution that comes to mind when approaching this problem is using the Set data structure or the filter method in
JavaScript. These are effective and most likely the solution to be used in most cases. In terms of doing this from scratch, we can create a 
method that loops over the bigger of the 2 arrays and checks to see if the elements of these arrays match. This is a very fast solution
with O(n) time complexity.
