Created a container div that holds the slide div inside of it. The job of the upper container is to center the slide show. The slide show is responsible
for managing the slide content inside of it. I multiple divs inside which hold each slide's content and they will be rendered conditionally using JavaScript.
Javascript is used to control which slide to show by setting the display of all slides to none expect for the current slide index. Improvments can be
made to the look and especially to the transtions of the slideshow.
